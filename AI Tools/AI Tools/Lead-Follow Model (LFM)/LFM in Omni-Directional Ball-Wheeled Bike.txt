The Omni-Directional Ball-Wheeled Bike, engineered by James Bruton, exemplifies the application of lead-follow modeling in its control architecture. This innovative vehicle utilizes a system where leading components, such as the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and microcontroller, continuously monitor and interpret the bike's dynamic state. These leading elements process real-time data on acceleration, orientation, and angular velocity, subsequently directing the follower components—specifically, the electric motors and omni-wheels—to execute precise adjustments. This hierarchical interaction ensures the bike maintains balance and responds adeptly to rider inputs, embodying the principles of lead-follow dynamics.

In this context, the IMU serves as the primary sensor, detecting any deviations from the desired equilibrium. Upon sensing a tilt or shift, it communicates this information to the microcontroller, which acts as the decision-making unit. The microcontroller processes the incoming data and calculates the necessary corrective actions, transmitting commands to the motors to adjust their torque and speed accordingly. This feedback loop operates continuously, with the leading components guiding the followers to achieve and maintain the desired state of balance and motion. Such a system exemplifies lead-follow modeling by delineating clear roles where sensors and controllers lead, and actuators follow, resulting in coordinated and stable operation.

The successful implementation of lead-follow modeling in the Omni-Directional Ball-Wheeled Bike highlights its potential in advanced mobility solutions. By structuring the control system with defined leading and following roles, the bike achieves a harmonious interaction between its components, facilitating complex maneuvers and stability. This approach not only enhances the performance of the vehicle but also serves as a paradigm for future developments in robotics and dynamic systems, where lead-follow dynamics can be leveraged to achieve sophisticated control and coordination.
